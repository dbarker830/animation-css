<h1 class="slide-in-blurred-bottom"> Why being a Chef is my favorite hobby (and former career)</h1>

    <p>Being a chef is an extremely rewarding experience. After you get into the right restaurant with a Head Chef that actually gives a darn about your career and teaching you the ins and outs of cooking, the skies are the limit. 
        Getting to cook Chilean Sea Bass, Scallops, Yellow Fin Tuna, steaks like a 48 ounce Tomahawk or a 14 ounce, 45 day aged grass-fed Ribeye was so much fun. <br>
        like a lot of people hear though, the kitchen industry can be very toxic and there's always pressure to keep getting better. Between walk-outs and the unfortunate nighttime schedule the resturant industry tends to keep people on, I left. 
        I also wanted to make more money, but I still continue to chef it up at home one or two nights a week.</p>
